The topics covered are C++ STL,Sorting and Searching,Time Complexity,Greedy algorithms,Bit manupulation,Number Theory and Dynamic Programming.

---
## Week 1(C++ STL,Sorting and Searching):
STL containers(vectors,maps,sets,stack and queue) and their built-in functions and Sorting and Searching techniques given the contstraints have been covered.Few basic and important algorithms like sort and reverse functions have been studied.These help in faster implementation.  
I have learnt the time complexity which helped me optimise the code and decide the best one to be used in the contests.I started to build  templates and use them accordingly to reduce effort and time taken.I have learnt to execute the right sorting or searching strategy according to the input constraints.

## Week 2(Greedy Algorithms and Bit manipulation):
Learnt how to make local optimal choices that are globally optimal.  
Understood to solve the corner cases in greedy algorithms.  
Explored bitwise operators (AND,OR,XOR,NOT) and shifts.  
Understood and applied bit manipulation on various problems.

---

## Week 3(Number Theory,Combinatorics,Probability)
Learnt to generate primes using Sieve of Eratosthenes
learnt Euclid's totient function,modular exponentiation,inverse,combinatoric techniques.
